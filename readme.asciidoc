=== STILL NOT CONVINCED? ===

Well, then go try a different Serverpack for Windows.
You might find a https://github.com/jakoch/WPN-XM/wiki/Comprehensive-list-of-server-stacks[comprehensive list of server stacks] in our wiki.
I know you’ll come back.

=== HOW TO BUILD THE INSTALLER ===

Just execute "build.bat". That's it. It's a one-click build.
You might then find the setup executable(s) in the folder "_build".

Find a detailed description on how this works in the one-click build process documentation.
https://github.com/jakoch/WPN-XM/wiki/Description-of-the-one-click-build-process

==== HOW TO BUILD THE INSTALLER MANUALLY ====

Building the installer manually means loading and compiling
the InnoSetup Script with Innosetup.

*Requirements*

* Windows OS
* Innosetup (http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) or
* ISTools (optional) (http://sourceforge.net/projects/istool/)

*Build*

* open "wpn-xm.iss" with InnoSetup or ISTools
* search and replace any tokens like @DEBUG@ (true/false) and @APPVERSION@ (1.2.3)
* use GUI to compile it
