*WPИ-XM is a free and open-source web server solution stack for professional PHP development on the Windows platform.*

The groundation of the server stack consists of NGINX, PHP and MariaDB.
Additionally XDebug, XhProf and Webgrind were added for profiling and debugging purposes; phpMyAdmin and Adminer for MySQL database administration purposes; memcached and APCu for caching; ZeroMQ for socket magic.
WPИ-XM provides a webinterface for server administration and a server control panel (tray application) which makes starting and stopping of daemons easy.
The abbreviation WPИ-XM consists of the initial letters of Windows, PHP, NGINX, XDebug and MariaDB.

The stack has a "Software Components Registry", which is an online database of all software components provided by the project.
This registry is maintained via the "Registry Updater", which allows crawling the vendor sites for latest versions of their software and updates the registry accordingly.
The registry is exposed via our WEB-API. All packages are available for selective download.

WPИ-XM provides 4 Installation Wizards, which are build in a One-Click-Build process.
The Webinstaller is 1 MB of size and and uses our WEB-API to retrieve and install the latest versions of software components.
The Lite Installer ships only a minimal set of components.
The Standard Installer ships components relevant for PHP development.
The Full Installer ships our whole registry and includes Strawberry Perl & PostgreSQL.
