WPИ-XM
------

*WPИ-XM is a free and open-source web server solution stack for professional PHP development on the Windows platform.*

The groundation of the server stack consists of NGINX, PHP and MariaDB.
Additionally XDebug, XhProf and Webgrind were added for profiling and debugging purposes; phpMyAdmin and Adminer for MySQL database administration purposes; memcached and APC for caching; ZeroMQ for socket magic.
WPИ-XM provides a webinterface for server administration and a server control panel (tray application) which makes starting and stopping of daemons easy.
The abbreviation WPИ-XM consists of the initial letters of Windows, PHP, NGINX, XDebug and MariaDB.

The stack has a "Software Components Registry", which is an online database of all software components provided by the project.
This registry is maintained via the "Registry Updater", which allows crawling the vendor sites for latest versions of their software and updates the registry accordingly.
The registry is exposed via our WebAPI. All packages are available for selective download.

WPИ-XM provides 4 Installation Wizards, which are build in a One-Click-Build process.
The Webinstaller, which is 1 MB of size and uses the WebAPI to retrieve and install the latest versions of software components.
The Lite Installer, which ships only a minimal set of components.
The All-In-One Installer, which ships components relevant for PHP development.
And the Big-Pack Installer, which ships the whole registry and includes Strawberry Perl & PostgreSQL.
