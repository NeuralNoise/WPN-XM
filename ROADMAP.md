## Roadmap

We are continually improving the software to make it an even more valuable product for developers.

This roadmap makes clear and transparent, where the project is heading.

**Product over Project**

The products delivered by the WPN-XM project do not have a final delivery,
rather an on-going process of exploring how best to support the developers
by optimizing the installers, maintaining the software registry,
optimizing the build-toolchain and the default configuration of installed tools.

**No time-slots**

The mental model of a project, something that is planned, executed, and delivered within defined time-slots doesn't fit this open-source project well. The day to day work is done by solving individual Github Issues. Issues remain open until a contributor to the project works on it, solves the problem and closes the issue.
