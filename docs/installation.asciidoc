Installing the WPN-XM Server Stack on Windows

This document explains how to install WPN-XM Server Stack for Windows.
You might install WPN-XM either by using the common user interface or
by installing it in silent mode. The silent mode is for integration
with automatic and unmaintained installation procedures.

Installation UI
---------------

This is the typical mode of installation.
To start the installer, just click on wpnxm-<major>.<minor>.<patch>.exe, e.g. wpnxm-0.1.exe.

On the Custom Setup Screen you might choose what software components and features to install.
The drop-down box will show you four default software component preselections you might choose from.

There are four default setups:
1) Full Installation
       This preselects everything for installation.
2) Server Stack with Administration Tools
	   Base (NGINX, MariaDB, PHP)
	   + Admin Tools (Tray App, Webinterface)
3) Server Stack with Debug Tools
	   Base (NGINX, MariaDB, PHP)
	   + Admin Tools (Tray App, Webinterface)
	   + Debug Tools (xhProf, XDebug, webgrind)
4) Custom Installation
	   This deselects everything and you might choose freely.

==  Select the Startmenu Folder

Installation logs
-----------------

If you encounter a bug in the installer, you might read the installer logs for diagnosis.
Please attach the logs when creating bug reports.

Silent installation / Unattended installation
-----------------------------------------------

In our experience, the "/silent" switch is usually sufficient for a basic unattended installation.
But to be completely sure, we recommend "/sp- /silent /norestart" as startup parameters.

There is also the parameter "/verysilent". If you use "/verysilent", my advise is to use the
parameter "/norestart" as well, just to be sure that the machine will not reboot without prompting
after or during the installation procedure.

You might also specify the target directory for the installation by using the parameter "/dir" (/dir="x:\dirname").

Using the pieces of information provided above, then a complete silent installation cli call would look like this:
"*setup.exe /VERYSILENT /SP- /DIR="C:\INSTALL_DIR" /NORESTART".

The switches for Inno Setup Silent Installation are fully documented in the ISetup.hlp file in the Inno distribution.

Silent uninstallation
---------------------

The uninstaller program (unins???.exe) accepts optional command line parameters.
You might use the parameters "/verysilent" and "/norestart".
